## Introduction

Package **traits4models** is designed to facilitate creating plant species parameter tables for process-based models. Specifically utility functions are provided to harmonize plant trait data bases and defining tables from them. At present, species parameter estimation is tailored to be used for the models included in package [medfate](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate), but it other functions could be added to become useful for other process-based models. 

## Package installation

Since both packages evolve together, installing **traits4models** normally requires an up-to-date version of package **medfate**, which is available at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=medfate). 

The latest stable versions GitHub as follows (required package `remotes`` should be installed/updated first):

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/traits4models")
```


## Usage

IMPORTANT: The package is still under active development. 

## Documentation

A number of *vignettes* illustrate how to initialize inputs and run simulation models in **traits4models**. These can be found at the package [website](https://emf-creaf.github.io/traits4models/).

## Companion R packages

The development of **traits4models** is intended to complement other packages of the same modelling framework:

  + Package [**medfateland**](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfateland) extends **medfate** by allowing simulations to be performed in a spatially explicit context.
  + Package [**meteoland**](https://emf-creaf.github.io/meteoland) allows generating daily weather input for simulation models in **medfate** and **medfateland**.

## Authorship

The set of R packages are developed and maintained by the [*Ecosystem Modelling Facility*](https://emf.creaf.cat) unit at [*CREAF*](https://www.creaf.cat/) (in Spain), in close collaboration with researchers from [*URFM-INRAE*](https://www6.paca.inrae.fr/ecologie_des_forets_mediterraneennes/) (in France) and [*CTFC*](https://www.ctfc.cat/) (in Spain).
